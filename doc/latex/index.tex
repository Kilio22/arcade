\subsection*{Game}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First, you wanna create a c++ class implementing the \mbox{\hyperlink{classArcade_1_1Games_1_1IGameModule}{I\+Game\+Module}} interface.
\item Next you wanna compile it into a dynamic library (.so file).
\item Put that library file in the {\ttfamily games/} folder located at the root of the arcade repository.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Every class contained by the libraries located in the {\ttfamily games/} folder are

going to be instanciated thanks to the symbol {\ttfamily create\+Lib} that your library {\bfseries{must}} contain.
