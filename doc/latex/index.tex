\subsection*{Game}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First, you wanna create a c++ class implementing the \mbox{\hyperlink{classArcade_1_1Games_1_1IGameModule}{I\+Game\+Module}} interface.
\item Next you wanna compile it into a dynamic library (.so file).
\item Put that library file in the {\ttfamily games/} folder located at the root of the arcade repository.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that it must follow the following naming expression \+: {\itshape lib\+\_\+arcade\+\_\+.+\textbackslash{}.so}, so that means a name like {\bfseries{lib\+\_\+arcade\+\_\+\$gamename.\+so}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Every class contained by the libraries located in the {\ttfamily games/} folder are going to be instanciated using the symbol {\ttfamily create\+Lib} that your library {\bfseries{must}} contain.

It should be as following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{extern} \textcolor{stringliteral}{"C"} std::unique\_ptr<Arcade::Games::IGameModule> createLib(\textcolor{keywordtype}{void})}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} std::make\_unique<MyGameModule>();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Library}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First, you wanna create a c++ class implementing the \mbox{\hyperlink{classArcade_1_1Display_1_1IDisplayModule}{I\+Display\+Module}} interface.
\item Next you wanna compile it into a dynamic library (.so file).
\item Put that library file in the {\ttfamily lib/} folder located at the root of the arcade repository.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that it must follow the following naming expression \+: {\itshape lib\+\_\+arcade\+\_\+.+\textbackslash{}.so}, so that means a name like {\bfseries{lib\+\_\+arcade\+\_\+\$libraryname.\+so}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Every class contained by the libraries located in the {\ttfamily lib/} folder are going to be instanciated using the symbol {\ttfamily create\+Lib} that your library {\bfseries{must}} contain.

It should be as following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{extern} \textcolor{stringliteral}{"C"} std::unique\_ptr<Arcade::Display::IDisplayModule> createLib(\textcolor{keywordtype}{void})}
